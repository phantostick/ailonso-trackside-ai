# Voice Input Fix - Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

**Root Cause**: The `VoiceAssistant.tsx` component was using the `react-speech-recognition` library wrapper, which requires a global polyfill initialization that was never set up. Meanwhile, `AvatarTTS.tsx` was using the native browser Web Speech API directly, which worked correctly.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote `VoiceAssistant.tsx` to use the **native Web Speech API** directly (matching the working implementation in `AvatarTTS.tsx`), eliminating the dependency on the library wrapper for this component.

## Changes Made

### 1. VoiceAssistant.tsx
- ‚úÖ Removed `react-speech-recognition` library dependency from this component
- ‚úÖ Implemented native `SpeechRecognition` API directly
- ‚úÖ Added continuous recognition with interim results
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling for permission, no-speech, and other errors
- ‚úÖ Single Start/Stop toggle button
- ‚úÖ Real-time interim transcript display (shows what you're saying as you speak)
- ‚úÖ Auto-processes final transcript and sends to Gemini
- ‚úÖ Detects search commands ("search hoodie", "find cap") and triggers callbacks

### 2. AvatarTTS.tsx
- ‚úÖ Already working correctly with native API
- ‚úÖ Enhanced with better continuous mode handling
- ‚úÖ Improved interim text display
- ‚úÖ Better start/stop controls

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. **Browser**: Use **Chrome** or **Edge** (Firefox desktop doesn't support Web Speech API)
2. **HTTPS or localhost**: Must be on `http://localhost:8082` (already correct)
3. **Microphone permission**: Allow when prompted

### Testing Steps

#### Test 1: Ask Alonso Button (AvatarTTS)
1. Go to homepage: http://localhost:8082
2. Click the "üé§ Ask Alonso" button
3. **When it starts listening**, you should see:
   - Button changes to "Stop Listening"
   - Status indicator shows microphone icon üé§
   - Avatar has a pulsing ring
4. **Speak clearly**: "What is Formula 1"
5. **Watch for interim text** (gray italic text showing what you're saying)
6. **After you finish**, it should:
   - Show your message in chat
   - Display "Thinking..." state
   - Generate a response via Gemini
   - Speak the response out loud

#### Test 2: Navigation Commands
1. Click "üé§ Ask Alonso"
2. Say: **"Open Style Studio"**
3. Should navigate to the merchandise page

Other commands to try:
- "Go to simulator"
- "Open trivia"
- "Show me profile"
- "Clip it"

#### Test 3: VoiceAssistant Component (if rendered separately)
1. Navigate to where VoiceAssistant is rendered
2. Click "Start Listening"
3. Say: **"Search hoodie"**
4. Should:
   - Detect the search command
   - Call the search callback (if wired)
   - Generate Gemini response
   - Speak reply

### Troubleshooting

#### "No speech detected" error after 7 seconds
- **Cause**: Microphone not capturing audio
- **Fix**: 
  - Click the lock icon in address bar
  - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Allow
  - Refresh page and try again

#### "Microphone permission denied" error
- **Cause**: You clicked "Block" on permission prompt
- **Fix**:
  - Click lock icon ‚Üí Site settings
  - Change Microphone to "Allow"
  - Reload page

#### Button does nothing when clicked
- **Cause**: Wrong browser (Firefox) or not on localhost
- **Fix**: 
  - Use Chrome or Edge
  - Ensure URL is `http://localhost:8082`

#### Interim text not showing
- **Not an error**: Interim text only shows while you're actively speaking
- It disappears when final text is captured
- Some browsers may delay interim updates

#### Permission prompt doesn't appear
- **Cause**: Previous block persists in browser settings
- **Fix**: Manually allow in chrome://settings/content/microphone

### Expected Behavior

‚úÖ **Working correctly if:**
- Button changes state when clicked (listening indicator appears)
- Interim text shows while speaking (gray, italic)
- Final transcript appears after speaking
- Gemini generates a response
- Response is spoken via TTS
- Navigation commands work
- Console shows "Recognition started" (if debug enabled)

‚ùå **Still broken if:**
- Button click does nothing
- No interim text ever appears
- Transcript stays empty after speaking
- Console shows permission errors
- No sound from microphone test (Windows sound settings)

## Technical Details

### Native API Implementation
```typescript
const SR = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
const recognition = new SR();
recognition.continuous = true;      // Don't stop after first result
recognition.interimResults = true;  // Get partial results while speaking
recognition.lang = 'en-US';

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  // Process interim and final results
};

recognition.start();  // Begin listening
```

### Key Differences from Library Wrapper
- **Direct control** over recognition lifecycle
- **Better error handling** with specific error types
- **Interim results** work reliably
- **No polyfill dependency** required
- **Explicit state management** (no hidden library state)

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Chrome | ‚úÖ Full support | Recommended |
| Edge | ‚úÖ Full support | Recommended |
| Brave | ‚úÖ Full support | May need shields adjustment |
| Opera | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Chromium-based versions work |
| Firefox | ‚ùå Not supported | Desktop lacks Web Speech API |
| Safari | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | Some versions support, others don't |

## Performance Notes

- **Continuous mode** auto-restarts recognition if it ends prematurely
- **ProcessedRef guard** prevents duplicate processing of the same utterance
- **Manual stop flag** prevents unwanted auto-restart after user stops
- **7-second timeout** warns if no speech detected (permission issue)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Wake word detection**: Activate on "Hey Alonso" or "Fernando"
2. **Streaming responses**: Show Gemini output token-by-token
3. **Voice activity detection**: Visual feedback of audio level
4. **Multi-language support**: Switch between languages
5. **Conversation persistence**: Save chat history to localStorage
6. **Backend proxy**: Move API key to server for production security

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Voice input now captures speech correctly in both components
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Components**: VoiceAssistant.tsx, AvatarTTS.tsx
